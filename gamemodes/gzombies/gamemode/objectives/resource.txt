I'm thinking, instead of having individual quests/objectives, there's multiple available (~3?) and you can do as many as you want, but you need to complete at least 1 before extracting/leaving.
Certain objectives might be completable only by 1 person, others might be completable by multiple/everyone. There should be some sort of description of the objectives given to everyone, but you don't
know if a certain solo objective has been completed (i.e. find a specific tiem) until someone's extracted with it.
