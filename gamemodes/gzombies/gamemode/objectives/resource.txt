I'm thinking, instead of having individual quests/objectives, there's multiple available (~3?) and you can do as many as you want, but you need to complete at least 1 before extracting/leaving.
Certain objectives might be completable only by 1 person, others might be completable by multiple/everyone. There should be some sort of description of the objectives given to everyone, but you don't
know if a certain solo objective has been completed (i.e. find a specific tiem) until someone's extracted with it.

Ideas:
    - Similar to Tarkov, there's different vendors, but the set of quests come from them at random
    - There's two "kinds" of quests: specific and generic
        - Specific include things like interacting with an object on the map or retrieving a specific object, only one player can complete these
        - Generic include extracting with a certain amount of a certain loot type, all players can complete these individually
    - 

General Quest Ideas:
    - Specific object retrieval
    - Specific object interaction
    - Loot retrieval
    - Kill players (they drop dog tags you can pick up)
    - Kill zombies
